class CehrBertModelOutput(ModelOutput):
    """
    Base class for model's outputs that may also contain a past key/values (to speed up sequential decoding).

    Args:
        loss (*optional*, returned when `labels` is provided, `torch.FloatTensor` of shape `(1,)`):
            The masked language modeling loss.

        prediction_logits (`torch.FloatTensor` of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length, config.vocab_size)`):
            Prediction scores of the language modeling head (scores for each vocabulary token before SoftMax).

        last_hidden_state (`torch.FloatTensor` of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length, hidden_size)`):
            Sequence of hidden-states at the output of the last layer of the model.

        attentions (`tuple(torch.FloatTensor)`, *optional*, returned when `output_attentions=True` is passed or when `config.output_attentions=True`):
            Tuple of `torch.FloatTensor` (one for each layer) of shape `(batch_size, num_heads, sequence_length,
            sequence_length)`.

            Attentions weights after the attention softmax, used to compute the weighted average in the self-attention
            heads.

            Last layer hidden-state of the first token of the sequence (classification token) after further processing
            through the layers used for the auxiliary pretraining task. E.g. for BERT-family of models, this returns
            the classification token after processing through a linear layer and a tanh activation function. The linear
            layer weights are trained from the next sentence prediction (classification) objective during pretraining.
